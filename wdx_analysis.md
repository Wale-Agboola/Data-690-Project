# United States vs. Nigeria (1st World and 3rd World)

**Wale Agboola**

## Introduction:
Being born in Nigeria but being raised in the United States its safe to say I have deep ties to both countries. I have always thought about how these two countries compared to one another since they are "categorized' as first and third world countries. Growing up we are taught the vast differences that first world countries and third world countries have agaisn't each other whether is be related to economic growth. Given the data set provided by the world bank  want to see if this really is the case and also see the strides both countries have made over the years. Since the time period I'm looking at for both countries is from 2010 - 2018 I am expecting both countries to have advanced significatly from the past. Also I do realize the size of both countries are significatly different so that is something to keep in mind when viewing the results. I will be viewing data results of the world bank data set using a dashboard created by Professor Wang linked here http://www.worlddev.xyz/ . This dashboard was created using data pulled from the world back website linked here https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/ . 

## Key things I'm looking for and Questions to answer:
The three main areas I'm looking to focus on for this study are Education, Economy and growth, and Health. The indicators will be based on these three topics.

- Education plays a pivotal role in any countries growth without it a countries chances for advancement are very slim. 
    - Within Education I will be focusing on data regarding primary and secondary education 
    - In todays aga in America we have a pretty good idea what type of jobs and careers person with only primary education can recieve vs a person with both primary and secondary education.
    - I want to see the disparty in primary and secondary education in both the United States and Nigeria.
    
- Economy and Growth gives you a picture of how the country is doing monetarily and how its near future looks like. Having a strong economy is pivitol when categorizing a country as eith 1st, 2nd, or 3rd world country. A countries economy plays a vital part on how the country is viewed throughout the world. 
    - For an good indicator of how a country is currently doing economically youe want to look at the GDP current measurement. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident procedures in the economy plus and product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.
    - In order to see how a country will being doing econmically in the near future it is good to look at the GDP Growth measurement. GDP growth is the annual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency.
    
- A country's health is another indicator to how advanced that country currently is. Advancements in medication and overall health and well being shows you can have good and stable population which can lead to population growth and a higher workforce count thus leading towards economic growth. 
    - When looking at health you want to see the amount of doctors andd physicians a country has at their disposle in case of a health emergency. Physicians include generalist and specialist medical practitioners.
    - I also what to see if there was a correlation between the number of physicians and life expectency. My intial thinking is that if the physician count is low then life expectancy at birth should be low in theory. I want to see if this is actually the case in both of these countries. 
    - Sanitation is another big indicator when it comes to health. If sanitation infrastructure has yet to be updated that can have a negative affect on the population count. Also being that I'm looking from 2010 - 2018 im hoping for both countries to have optimal sanitation levels. Specifically I will be looking at the percentage of population using improved saniitation facilities.
