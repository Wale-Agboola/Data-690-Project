# United States vs. Nigeria (1st World and 3rd World)

**Wale Agboola**

## Introduction:
Being born in Nigeria but being raised in the United States its safe to say I have deep ties to both countries. I have always thought about how these two countries compared to one another since they are "categorized' as first and third world countries. Growing up we are taught the vast differences that first world countries and third world countries have agaisn't each other whether is be related to economic growth. Given the data set provided by the world bank  want to see if this really is the case and also see the strides both countries have made over the years. Since the time period I'm looking at for both countries is from 2010 - 2018 I am expecting both countries to have advanced significatly from the past. Also I do realize the size of both countries are significatly different so that is something to keep in mind when viewing the results. I will be viewing data results of the world bank data set using a dashboard created by Professor Wang linked here http://www.worlddev.xyz/ . This dashboard was created using data pulled from the world back website linked here https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/ . 

## Key things I'm looking for and Questions to answer:
The three main areas I'm looking to focus on for this study are Education, Economy and growth, and Health. The indicators will be based on these three topics.

- Education plays a pivotal role in any countries growth without it a countries chances for advancement are very slim. 
    - Within Education I will be focusing on data regarding primary and secondary education 
    - In todays aga in America we have a pretty good idea what type of jobs and careers person with only primary education can recieve vs a person with both primary and secondary education.
    - I want to see the disparty in primary and secondary education in both the United States and Nigeria.
    
- Economy and Growth gives you a picture of how the country is doing monetarily and how its near future looks like. Having a strong economy is pivitol when categorizing a country as eith 1st, 2nd, or 3rd world country. A countries economy plays a vital part on how the country is viewed throughout the world. 
    - For an good indicator of how a country is currently doing economically youe want to look at the GDP current measurement. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident procedures in the economy plus and product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.
    - In order to see how a country will being doing econmically in the near future it is good to look at the GDP Growth measurement. GDP growth is the annual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency.
    
- A country's health is another indicator to how advanced that country currently is. Advancements in medication and overall health and well being shows you can have good and stable population which can lead to population growth and a higher workforce count thus leading towards economic growth. 
    - When looking at health you want to see the amount of doctors andd physicians a country has at their disposle in case of a health emergency. Physicians include generalist and specialist medical practitioners.
    - I also what to see if there was a correlation between the number of physicians and life expectency. My intial thinking is that if the physician count is low then life expectancy at birth should be low in theory. I want to see if this is actually the case in both of these countries. 
    - Sanitation is another big indicator when it comes to health. If sanitation infrastructure has yet to be updated that can have a negative affect on the population count. Also being that I'm looking from 2010 - 2018 im hoping for both countries to have optimal sanitation levels. Specifically I will be looking at the percentage of population using improved saniitation facilities. 

## Key Findings and Analysis:

**GDP per Capita in 2010 vs 2018**

2010:

2018:

2010 - 2018:

Comments:

As you can tell by the graph the United already had a huge GDP per capita in 2010 when the data starts and all the way til 2018 the both countries see increases in their GDP but Nigeria's increase is alot less noticeable. In the United you can clearly see that in an eight year time stretch that they had significant GDP Growth. One of the significant econmic changes that could have led to this growth in the US happend in 2015 when President Obama enacted the affordable care act that gave medical coverage for over 20 million people. And with money being spent on hospital billss and such Americans added wealth added back to the economy in increased spending habits of the american citizens. Even though Nigeria has seen some GDP growth in this time span it is not alot, why is that? Nigeria has faced its share of struggles. There is always corruption in the government that makes it difficult for any real impactful change to occur and tribes within Nigeria are always fighting one another. Yes Nigeria has had some advancements in technology and agriculture but because of the high negatives the positive events throughout this timespan gbecome overshadowed thus the GDP per capita doesn't increase as much.

**Life Expectency**

2010 - 2018:

Comments:

Unlike GDP per Capita you can clearly see that Nigeria had the more impactful growth when it comes to Life expectency in 2010 through 2018. Historically Nigeria's health care network has been rated among the worst in the world (142 out of 195 countries). But recent improvements have made it so that the country is has a much brighter future ahead of it. Vaccinations have become more prevelant making Nigeria better equipped to deal with such infectious diseases. In the United States advancements are still being made medically but it already had a good healthcare infrastructure so the change isn't as signifcant as Nigeria. 

**GDP Growth over Time**

2010 - 2018:

![alt text](GDP_Growth_Line.png "GDP Growth")

Comments:


Now previously we looked at GDP per capita and what changes were had. The chart above shows the GDP growth over time and since we are looking at an eight year period the change shouldn't be too significant on a first world country like the United states but if you take a look at Nigeria the growth was continually decreasing but then during 2016 it began to increase and its growth alomost was on par with the United States toward 2018 and beyond. Like mentioned before Nigeria haas its share economic problems but recently has been making strides and with additional help from allying countries have made it so that it is headed in the right direction question for the future is that if it will continue on this trajectory.

**Physicians and Life Expectency**

2010:

Comments:

Here we can kinda of see the relationship between the number of physicians and the life expectency at birth. Like I hypothesized it seems that there is some correlation between the two. In the United states we see that a high physicain count equates to a longer life expectancy and for Nigeria the low physcian count equates to a lower life expectancy. Now we have to remember size wize the US is alot larger than Nigeria but with this you can see how much more medically advanced the United States is compared to Nigeria. But here you clearly see that the number of doctors in a country is paramount to the country's life expectancy rate.

**Physicians**

Comments:

Here we can see that the United states has a higher physician count than Nigeria. Even though the United States has more physicians we can see that the number of phycicians has increased from 2010 to 2018.

**Primary School Enrollment**

2010 - 2018:

Comments:

Now looking at the education between both schools we can see a great disparity among the two countries. The United States has had a constant increase of students enrolling in primary and secondary school. Now we have to keep in mind that the United states has alot more options for schooling for both primary and secondary so students have alot more options to choose from when deciding to go to school. Now Nigeria seems as it had a steady increase for primary and secondary school enrollments but then in 2013 there was a huge dip in the enrollment but again there was a reason behind that. In 2013 in Nigeria there were attacks made by a militant Islamist group and also govrnment abuse both led to a downward spiral in both the econmony and education system as there was violence accross the country causing most families to take shelter and most children either not enrolling or dropping out of school that year. These trends in data always line up with certain historical events we just have to be able to make the connection.

## Conclusion:

Overall we've been able to see some major discrepencies between the United States and Nigeria. Being 1st and 3rd world countries it would be difficult to find major similarities among both. But we did notices spots in the time span where they had similar trends. Overall through these charts an analysis we can see how some indicator can have impacts on others and affect a countries economic status and infrastructure.
